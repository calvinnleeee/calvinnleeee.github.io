This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Calvin Lee

Small project to make my own website, while learning about and using Next.js and React to gain skills in industry-relevant libraries and modules. Hopefully this website and my Github can showcase a little bit of how I code to others. :)
