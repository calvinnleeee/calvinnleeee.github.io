## Calvin Lee

Little bit about me: dance game player, student, programmer. I love problem solving: programming, gaming, social interactions, anything can be turned into a problem and solved :)

Currently: 
* BCIT CST diploma student, graduating May 2025. Previous undergrad studies in electrical engineering.
* Thinking of doing an AWS certificate or a Google certificate (or maybe both?)
* Leetcoding away! (Not to pass interviews, but to improve my problem-solving skills and habits)
