Little bit about me: dance game player, student, programmer. I love problem solving: programming, gaming, social interactions, anything can be turned into a problem and solved :)

Currently: 
* BCIT CST diploma student, graduating May 2025. Previous undergrad studies in electrical engineering.
* (Finally) updating this website and doing something with it
* Thinking of doing an AWS certificate or a Google certificate (or maybe both?)
* Looking for a job to use my programming, problem-solving, and/or leadership and team management skills!
